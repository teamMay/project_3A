# MAY - Project ECM 3A 2021

This is a project for student from [Ecole Centrale Marseille](https://www.centrale-marseille.fr) aiming to discover sentiment analysis through different methods and serve an AI model through a website or an API.

## Sentiment analysis served through a web API

For local development, we use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) directly.

For production means, we can use FastAPI in pair with [Traefik](traefik.io).
